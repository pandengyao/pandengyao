## Hi there 👋

I am currently a **Research & Development Engineer** in the **Reinforcement Learning Group** of the **AI Computing Department** at [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/).  
I received my **M.S. degree in Instrument Science and Technology** from [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), and my **B.Eng. in Measurement, Control Technology and Instrumentation** from [Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)](https://english.njust.edu.cn/).

With **five years of industry experience**, I have worked across areas including **software development**, **ROS-based system integration**, **model quantization and deployment**, and **MLSys optimization**.  
My current research focuses on **Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL)** — exploring how autonomous agents can leverage reinforcement learning to enhance large-scale intelligent systems.

## Research Interests 🔭

My research primarily focuses on:
- **ML Systems**: Topics related to **SGLang**, **AI Infra**, and **High Performance Computing**.
- **RL Sys for Agents**: Topics related to **Coding Agent & Pipeline** and **RLHF for Multi-Agent Systems**.
